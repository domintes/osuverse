# Coolections Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added a new `/coolections` page to Osuverse with a modern UI inspired by osu.ppy.sh favorites list and randrop.io mechanics. This page provides an alternative, more visually appealing way to view and interact with user collections.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Page: `/coolections`
**File:** `app/coolections/page.js`

**Features:**
- **Grid & List View Modes**: Toggle between grid cards and list view
- **Random Beatmap Picker**: Similar to randrop.io - shuffle to get a random beatmap from your collections
- **Filter System**: 
  - All Beatmaps
  - Favorites only
  - To Check only
  - Filter by specific collection (excluding system collections)
- **Beatmap Set Grouping**: Beatmaps are grouped by beatmapset with expandable difficulties
- **Direct Links**: Click any beatmap/set to open it in osu.ppy.sh in a new tab
- **Beautiful Cards**: Each beatmap set displays:
  - Cover image background
  - Title, artist, mapper
  - Number of difficulties
  - Expandable difficulty list with star ratings
  - Individual difficulty chips with version names and star ratings

**UI Design Elements:**
- Gradient accent colors (purple to blue)
- Hover effects and animations
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Empty state with helpful message
- Random beatmap showcase card
- Filter tabs with beatmap counts

### 2. Styling: `app/coolections/coolections.scss`
**Features:**

- Smooth animations (shuffle spin, hover effects)
- Responsive breakpoints for mobile/tablet
- Card-based layout similar to osu.ppy.sh
- List view with full-width items
- Glass-morphism effects
- Custom scrollbars
- Accessibility-friendly focus states

**Color Scheme:**
- Primary: `var(--accent)` (#ea81fb - purple/pink)
- Secondary: #64c8ff (cyan/blue)
- Background overlays and transparency effects
- Consistent with existing Osuverse theme

### 3. Navigation Update
**File:** `src/components/Navigation.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added "Coolections" link to navbar between "Collections" and "About"
- Active state highlighting for `/coolections` route
- Mobile menu integration

### 4. Collection Name Display Fix
**File:** `src/components/UserCollectionsSection.jsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `.trim()` to collection and subcollection names to ensure proper display
- Added fallback "Unnamed Collection" if collection name is missing
- Ensures consistent name display across the app

- Local state for view mode, filters, random beatmap, and UI interactions

2. Sort options (by date added, star rating, etc.)
3. Bulk actions (select multiple, move to collection)
4. Custom themes/color schemes
5. Export/share collection as image
